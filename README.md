# CS440_CH04_Demo_Gupta_Rahul

For this project, I personally chose the MIT license for the reasons:
  a. Permissive license that is short and to the point.
  b. It allows you to share your code under a copyleft license without forcing others to expose their proprietary code.
  c. Business friendly and open source friendly while still allowing for monetization.
  d. Users of MIT licensed code can modify the original source and distribute it as a separate project.
